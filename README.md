### 💡 About Me

I’m a Full-Stack Engineer with experience across startups, enterprise teams, and academic innovation labs. I enjoy building systems end-to-end — from clean, scalable frontend architectures to backend services that integrate databases, cloud infrastructure, and AI models.

My recent work focuses on:

* AI-powered platforms with structured outputs and reliability safeguards

* Modern frontend stacks using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and MUI

* Cloud-deployed backend services with Docker, AWS, and CI/CD

* Applying AI where it adds real value, not just novelty
